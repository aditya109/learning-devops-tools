## Traditional IT and Challenges

### Traditional Route

Let's assume we have a company trying to launch an application.
We start off with an **Business Idea** which is penned down as high-level objectives by **Business Analyst**, the technical solution for which is given by a **Solution Architect/Technical Lead**. The resource requirements are then tendered by **Procurement** team. who may take weeks or even months depending on availability of hardware stocks. Once obtained, the resources are handed to infrastructure team, wherein,

1.  A team of **Field Engineers** look after the rack and hardware;
2. Initial configuration is done by **System Administrators**;
3. **NW Engineers** configure the networks and relevant connections;
4. Storage is configured by **Storage admins**;
5. Backups are configured by **Backup admins**;

Once all of this is done, it is then when it is handed over the **Application team** for development.

#### Cons:

- The turnover time is quite huge, consequently leading to slower deployment.
- On-the-go scaling requirements are also met really slow.
- Overall, cost-to-deploy for this type of model is quite high.
- The amount of automation being done is very less.
- With multiple teams working on the different tasks, the chances of human error is quite high.
- Also this often leads to inconsistency in the infra setup.
- Compute resources will also remain under-utilised. (The design is usually done using peak utilisation)
